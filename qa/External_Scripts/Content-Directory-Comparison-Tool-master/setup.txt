Output: Displays changes of files within "context". For example, the entire xml of the file will not be displayed but only the subsections of the file where the changes take place. 

To view xml differences in max capacity run execution as full screen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGLE FILE EXECUTION: To run the diff tool for single XML files run the 
XML_FILE_COMPARATOR.sh script. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependency:

Windows
To run the script on Windows Cygwin must be installed, as well as a few other dependencies including; X11, xmllint, vim*

All dependencies can be installed from the Cygwin Setup Tool.
The Cygwin Setup Tool Can be found: https://cygwin.com/install.html 

In the Cygwin Setup Tool Install:

~Debug
	-libxml2-debuginfo: Debug info for libxml2
~GNOME
	-xml2po
~Libs
	-libxml2: GNOME XML library (runtime) 
	-libxml2-devel: GNOME XML library (development)
	-libxml C++ bindings for libxml2 
~Search Vim in Cygwin Installer Search Bar
 vim
	-Install all from Base, Debug, Editors
~Entire X11 Package  -->[SEE NOTE]

Linux 

libxml2-utils - For xml lint and formating
vim - For viewing the compared files in terminal screen

Mac
xmllib2 (Almost all OSX evirnements come pre-packaged)
XQuartz (X11) -->[SEE NOTE]

*[SEE NOTE]
- X11 is not INSTALLED - 
	-The code has been written to that it supports AUTO rezise
	Commands using XQuartz (X11)
		resize -s 0 0
		printf '\e[3;0;0t'
	-These commands maximize screen so that VIM can split it evenly

- Steps Must be taken to evenly split the view pane:
	1. Manually adjust the screen size(FULL SCREEN IS RECOMMENDED)
	2. Within the dual pane screen user ':'' to enter insert mode and user 'winc =' to evenly distrubute

- X11 is INSTALLED -
Life is Easier!
